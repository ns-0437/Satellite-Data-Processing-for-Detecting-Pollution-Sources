# Satellite Data Processing for Detecting Pollution Sources

The dataset comprises 90 different animal images. Initially, we'll structure it for one-vs-rest classification, followed by binary classification, and then a 5-class classification problem. We'll evaluate each model's performance using classification matrices.

## 1. Dataset Preparation
- Organize the dataset for one-vs-rest classification. Perform binary classification using existing architectures and then restructure for 5-class classification. Use 3-fold cross-validation to assess the model.
- Preprocess images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to enhance model robustness and generalization.
- Implement data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and color jittering to improve model resilience to variations.
- Ensure proper resizing of images to a consistent input dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to match the CNN input requirements.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring balanced class distributions across splits.
- Generate descriptive statistics of the dataset splits to verify the balance and avoid data leakage.

## 2. Model Development
- Build a custom CNN model without using existing architectures like ResNet or DenseNet.
- Design the CNN architecture to include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers with ReLU activation and dropout regularization.
- Introduce batch normalization layers after each convolutional block to stabilize and accelerate training.
- Experiment with varying filter sizes, kernel dimensions, and layer depths to optimize feature extraction.
- Incorporate global average pooling before the fully connected layers to reduce model parameters while retaining essential spatial information.
- Implement a softmax output layer for multi-class classification tasks.
- Apply L2 regularization to weights and use an early stopping mechanism to mitigate overfitting.

## 3. Training and Evaluation
- Train the model on prepared datasets for one-vs-rest and 5-class classification.
- Optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to improve performance.
- Implement learning rate scheduling to adaptively reduce the learning rate when performance plateaus.
- Generate classification matrices for visualization and compare precision, recall, and F1 scores across classes.
- Track the training and validation loss over epochs to monitor overfitting and underfitting.
- Use metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and AUC-ROC curves to comprehensively evaluate performance.
- Employ kappa statistics to assess the model's agreement with ground truth labels.
- Conduct error analysis by reviewing misclassified samples to identify patterns and improve preprocessing or model architecture.

## 4. Convolutional Layer Visualization
- Plot the output of all convolutional layers and discuss the insights on automatically created features.
- Analyze feature maps to understand which patterns the model focuses on for each class, providing interpretability for the classification decisions.
- Visualize filters and gradients to identify the layers that contribute most to model performance and highlight potential areas for optimization.
- Apply Grad CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to produce heatmaps, indicating regions of interest in the input images for classification.
- Explore activation histograms for different layers to understand activation distributions and detect potential issues with dead neurons.
- Compare feature maps across training, validation, and test sets to evaluate generalization.
- Document all findings to guide future improvements in both data preparation and model design.

## 5. Additional Considerations
- Implement model explainability techniques to ensure the results are interpretable by non-technical stakeholders.
- Automate the model training and evaluation pipeline to streamline experiments and ensure reproducibility.
- Regularly back up intermediate results and checkpoints for recovery and analysis.
- Explore alternative optimization algorithms (e.g., AdamW or SGD with momentum) to enhance training dynamics.
- Conduct ablation studies to evaluate the impact of individual components, such as data augmentation or regularization, on performance.
- Present results visually in charts and tables to aid in understanding and decision-making.
- Collaborate with domain experts to validate the practical relevance of detected patterns and insights.
