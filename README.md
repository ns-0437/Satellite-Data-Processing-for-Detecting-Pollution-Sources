The dataset comprises 90 different animal images. Initially, we'll structure it for one-vs-rest classification, followed by binary classification and then a 5-class classification problem. We'll evaluate each model's performance using classification matrices.

1. Dataset Preparation:
   - Organize the dataset for one-vs-rest classification. Perform binary classification using existing architectures and then restructure for 5-class classification. Use 3-fold cross-validation to assess the model.

2. Model Development:
   - Build a custom CNN model without using existing architectures like ResNet or DenseNet.

3. Training and Evaluation:
   - Train the model on prepared datasets for one-vs-rest and 5-class classification.
   - Generate classification matrices for visualization.

4. Convolutional Layer Visualization:
   - Plot the output of all convolutional layers and discuss the insights on automatically created features.
